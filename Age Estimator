Age Estimator App

Overview
Developed an Android application that estimates a person's age from a photograph with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 10. The app leverages machine learning to provide quick and reasonably accurate age predictions directly on the device.

Key Features
- Photo capture using device camera
- Gallery integration for existing image selection
- Real-time age estimation from live camera feed
- Results display with estimated age and confidence level

Technical Stack
- Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)
- TensorFlow Lite for on-device ML
- Android Camera X library
- Android Jetpack components

Challenges Overcome
- Optimized ML model for mobile performance
- Implemented efficient image processing pipeline
- Balanced accuracy and app responsiveness

Future Improvements
- Further reduce MSE to below 5
- Enhance UI/UX design
- Add age progression/regression feature
- Implement batch processing capability

This project showcases proficiency in Android development, integration of machine learning models in mobile applications, and handling of camera and image processing tasks.
